# rnSpawnComponentDemo

This is an example react-native project for [rn-spawn-component](https://github.com/non-threatening/rn-spawn-component) on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-spawn-component)

> This has only been tested on Android and was built on my system.

If cloning the repo isn't working for you, an easy way to get up and running is to run:
```sh
npx react-native init AwesomeProject
yarn add rn-spawn-component
```
Then copy ```App.js``` and ```MyComponent.js``` to the project and run as usual.
